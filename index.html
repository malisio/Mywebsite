				Who am I ?
			</h2>

			<p class="intro">Hey there, I'm [Your Name], a 14-year-old with a real passion for cybersecurity. You could say I was practically born into the world of technology, growing up in a Linux environment from a young age. It sparked something in me—a curiosity and fascination with how systems work, how they can be secured, and sometimes, how they can be exploited.

				I've always been drawn to the idea of penetration testing, or what's often called red teaming. It's like being a digital detective, hunting down vulnerabilities in networks and web applications. And hey, I'm pretty good at it, if I do say so myself.
				
				One thing that sets me apart is my coding skills. I'm fluent in Python and Bash scripting, which really comes in handy when I'm automating tasks or digging deep into systems. It's amazing what you can uncover with just a few lines of code.
				
				But it's not all about the technical stuff for me. I believe in the importance of ethical hacking and responsible disclosure. It's not about causing harm; it's about making things better, safer.
				
				So yeah, that's me in a nutshell. A teenager with a laptop, a love for coding, and a mission to make the digital world a little bit safer, one line of code at a time.  </p>

				 <h3>Coding </h3>

				 <p>When it comes to coding, Python and Bash are my bread and butter. I've spent countless hours mastering these languages, and it shows in my work. With Python, I can tackle a wide range of tasks, from automating repetitive processes to building complex algorithms. Whether it's web scraping, data analysis, or creating GUI applications, Python is my go-to tool. And when it comes to system administration and automation, Bash scripting is where I shine. From writing concise scripts to streamline tasks on Linux systems to crafting intricate command pipelines, I'm always finding new ways to leverage Bash to make my workflow more efficient. These skills not only make me a versatile hacker but also empower me to solve problems creatively and efficiently in any project I undertake.

				<h3>Linux</h3>

				<p>Growing up in a Linux environment has given me a deep understanding of the inner workings of operating systems and the command line. Linux isn't just an operating system to me; it's a playground where I feel right at home. Whether it's navigating through directories, configuring system settings, or managing users and permissions, I'm fluent in the intricacies of Linux. From Ubuntu to Arch Linux, I've explored various distributions, each offering its own set of challenges and opportunities for learning. My familiarity with Linux extends beyond basic usage—I'm comfortable with shell scripting, package management, and even configuring network services. Linux isn't just a tool for me; it's a mindset—a philosophy of open-source collaboration and continuous learning that drives me to push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.</p>
